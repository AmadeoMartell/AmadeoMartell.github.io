            </div>
            <div class="roots-text">
                Our story began back in 1990 when two passionate travelers, Anna and Marco, <br> embarked on their first journey through Switzerland. They traversed the entire country, <br> exploring every nook and cranny, and engaging with the local residents. <br>Their passion for Switzerland was born out of a desire to share this unique beauty with others.
